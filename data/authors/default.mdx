Hi! I am Abdulhakeem Adefioye. I have 3 years of experience building software in non-profit and consumer electronics industry. In 2024, I started working at Sonos in the products team. 
At Sonos, I helped build and maintain client SDKs that power Sonos's mobile controllers both on Android and iOS. I solved problem that address concurrency and performance of the mobile controllers (used for controlling the smart speakers of Sonos's customers).

I was laid off from Sonos in 2025 and now made a pivot into AI. Since then, I have helped build an open source library, [Reasoning gym](https://github.com/open-thought/reasoning-gym), that has contributed immensely to LLM-based reasoning research and also got a co-authored paper published in NeurIPS.
Now, I am more focused on getting my hands dirty with low-level details of neural networks. By this I mean, how does LLM encode knowledge? how do they detect concepts? What are the causal mechanisms that can be used for explaining certain model behavior and finally discovering and explaining interesting model phenomena.
I will be experimenting with ideas or reproduce ideas I see in the wild and then make publications of interesting insights on my blog.

Please you're welcome to read articles I will be posting.
