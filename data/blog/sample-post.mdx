This is the only sample post left in the repo. Use it as a template when you’re ready to publish.

## 1) Create a new post

Add a new file in `data/blog/`, for example `data/blog/my-first-post.mdx`.

Minimum frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My First Post
date: '2026-01-16'
tags: ['ai', 'notes']
draft: false
summary: One or two sentences that show up in previews.
---
```

Tips:
- Set `draft: true` if you don’t want it to appear on the site yet.
- The URL comes from the filename (and any folders) under `data/blog/`.

## 2) Markdown + MDX examples

### Code block

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello ${name}`
}
```

### Links

- External link: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
- Internal link: `/about`

### Images (optional)

If you add an image to `public/static/images/your-image.png`, you can reference it like:

```mdx
![Alt text](/static/images/your-image.png)
```
